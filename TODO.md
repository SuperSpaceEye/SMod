# Survival Toolgun
* Just like normal toolgun, but uses resources to work
* Maybe have internal inventory for storing consumables? Or maybe just grab them directly from player's inventory
* Consumables will just be dummy items with no functionality aside from being used in toolgun (goodbye cursed tag ser/deser)
* Will allow for future viremod (wiremod) addon to easily have survival support maybe
* Will require redoing base vmod structure 
* I won't need wrench and other shite
* Maybe even directly paste schematics via toolgun (block will still be needed for large schems)

## Items to implement
* Wrench - item to edit/remove smod items
* Connection
* Rope
* Hydraulics
* Phys Rope
* Slider (it's unstable af currently though so maybe after physx)
* Collisions Disabler (probably too op, though you can always disable recipe)
* Scaler (probably too op, though you can always disable recipe)
* Gravity Changer (probably too op, though you can always disable recipe)
* block that builds vschems in survival

* Maybe 3d rendering (just a box or smth) with textures for Connection/Rope/Hydraulics

# Do this before release or smth idk
* define server limits for every item
